---------- How I build my app -------

- first, I create my project using react toolkit : npm create-react-app assigment, and then I delete default code of program
- install some pakage :
  - axios : get the response server API data
  - react-bootstrap : used to design tables
  - query-string : used to change param for url when performing pagination
- The project will be divided into 2 components: Pagination and Table

- The returned api data has 2 very important parts: results and infor. we get the data in the results to display on the table and and get data in info for pagination

- at App.js do get data from api using axios in useEffect Hook. and do save and update results and infor via
  useState : const [postList, setPostList] = useState([]);
  const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({
  page: 1,
  results: 10,
  });
  page and results được lấy trong infor là 2 param để chúng ta phân trang và được chuyển đổi thành chuỗi thông qua queryString và chúng sẽ được cập nhật qua useSatet setFilter , filter thay đổi khi chúng ta bấm nút Prev hoặc Next and là điều kiện để render lại table

-Because the data api returned is very complex, I have customized the data API to match the project through the function saveDateLocalStorage,After I have the data I want, I continue to save them to the Browser's localStorage

- At Paginatiom.jsx I have 2 buttons Prev and Next and they both have a click event function to handle when we click on them.When clicking the Prev button, the page variable will decrease until the page is less than or equal to 1, then the button will disable (cannot be clicked anymore) and when clicking the Next button, the page variable will increase by. the page variable will be handled in the handlePageChange function to update the filter in App.js, and every time the filter changes we get the data that the api returns.

- at TableList.jsx I will take the json that I have saved earlier in localStorage and update it in Sate as the dataTable is processed in useEffect and the table is re-rendered when new data is available. dataTable is a json array so I will use map to get each object and print them to the table cell

- In the header cells of the Full Name and User columns, I have event functions to perform sorting in ascending or descending alphabetical order. Ascending or descending will be updated in State as setOrder . When clicked, the handleSorting function will be called and rearrange the data in the table

-About the project's style I use sass and tailwind , boostrap to make the project UI more beautiful
